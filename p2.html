  Description
    </h3>
    
  <p1>
    By Lu Gan - I lost a thin, brick shaped electronic device in the cold winter sea. The front of it is smooth and shiny, with a thin membrane covered on it. On the back of it, there are two glasses-like circles. Its sides are uneven, has some rectangular protrusion. The whole object is protected by a transparent protecter
  </p1>
  <h3>
    Interpretation
  </h3>
  
  <p1>
    I imagine it to be a phone that was dropped into the ocean
  </p1>
  
  <h3>
    Reflection
  </h3>
  
  <p1>
    After interpreting what I thought the object that my partner was talking about was, I turned things into familiar symbols and shapes. I imaged the scene to be set at the beach, where the sun is setting. I had the reflection of the sun on the water be thin rectangles. She mentioned cold winter so I included small snowflakes the shake of squares and plus signs. I tried to add "shine" and a "clear protector". She descried the front of the object as well, but since this is a flat illustration, I only managed to illustrate one side. I had the most fun time choosing the colors to the illustration because it's so easy to change and experiment with. The most difficult part again was figuring out the coordinates, and also how the shapes rotated because I had to guess and check most of it.
