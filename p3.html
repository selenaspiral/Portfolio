  Design Process
    </h3>
    
  <p1>
     My initial idea was to create a face that had color changing eyes at random when you click with your mouse and to have hair that changed in length depending on where your mouse moved on the screen. I started with sketching out the eyes, and I thought about using bezier to create curved lines. It was a lot more difficult than I thought. I used illustrator to help me map out coordinates but most of the time it was not accurate so I had to go frequently guess and check different coordinates to see what matched well in the illustration. I ended up deciding to use curved abstract lines for the whole portrait. I used random and mousePressed to change the color of the eyes and I replaced coordinates from the beziers to mouseX or mouseY so that everytime you move your mouse, the hair and sparkles move with it.

    Though the bangs of the hair may not look exactly like bangs, it is an abstracted form of them and I quite like how it turned out. All the lines are very fluid and there are gaps between them, but you can still see that it is meant to be a face.
