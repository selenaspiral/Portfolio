  Design Process
    </h3>
    
  <p1>
     My initial idea was to create a face that had color changing eyes at random when you click with your mouse and <br>to have hair that changed in length depending on where your <br> mouse moved on the screen. I started with sketching out the eyes, and I thought about using bezier to create curved lines. It was a lot more difficult than I thought. I used illustrator to help me map out coordinates but most of the time it was not accurate so I had to go frequently guess and check different coordinates to see what matched well in the illustration. I ended up deciding to use curved abstract lines for the whole portrait. I used random and mousePressed to change the color of the eyes and I replaced coordinates from the beziers to mouseX or mouseY so that everytime you move your mouse, the hair and sparkles move with it.
