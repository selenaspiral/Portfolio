  Description
    </h3>
  <p1>
    This tree is constantly growing and shifting, like how everyday as artists our way of being creative and our way of generating new ideas grow and shift. The flowers change color and opacity every second, the tree grows taller every minute, and the trunch and branches get thicker every hour.

  Design process
         <p1>
           My first idea was to think about how nature grows and shift through out time, so I had the idea of creating a tree that grows in code. My second idea was to create something based off of my dreams, something like falling deeper and deeper into the dream state. So the opactity goes from 100% - 0% and then the shape goes from big to small, creating the illusion of a hole. Then my third idea was to create a shooting star illustration and the shooting stars would travel through the screen, each kind of shooting star would travel in seconds, minutes and hours. I ended up choosing the tree clock becuase I thought it had the strongest conceptual idea and also was an interesting clock to look at. It also could function as a useful clock, showing stages of where you should be at during your idea generating process.
