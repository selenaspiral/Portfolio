    Subin and Nuo. Subin designed the body, Nuo designed the head and I designed the legs.

  Design process

         <p1>
           Subin's background story: This is the monkey character who wants to become human. He came from jungle. He is evolving into human now.

        Nuo's background story: OO is a type of aliens that live on the planet O16. They have donut-shaped heads and torsos to decrease body weight in order to accommodate the gravity on their planet. They have spaghetti-shaped arms, which are what they use for breathing and catching certain particles in the air to eat. Red is the most popular color on their planet, so they often wear red accessories. A year in their planet is only 10 days, so they celebrate their birthday every 10 days. Thatâ€™s why you often see OOs wearing birthday hats.

        My background story: Ellie is from an alternate universe where everything is made of circles and ovals.

        I created a character using only the ellipse tool. After creating our own characters, we switched with two other people to create a character with a head, body and legs all made my different people, so this was a collaborative project. I tried to replicate each person's character based off of the shapes and colors shown in their sketches. After creating all the different parts, I started changing the colors to create a new character that was cohesive. Then at the end, I used arguments and parameters to change the colors of certain parts each time you refresh.
